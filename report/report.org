* TODO Introduction and goals

The goal of this project is to apply SVM techniques (in particular, the *Pegasos* algorithm) in order to obtain a reasonably good predictor for the task of /hand-written digit recognition/. 

* Dataset and pre-processing

** Dataset

The dataset is available at [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bistaumanga/usps-dataset][kaggle.com]].

The USPS dataset /"is a digit dataset automatically scanned from envelopes by the U.S. Postal Service"/.

The images are all in grayscale, with size 16x16. Each pixel is a value between 0 (black) and 1 (white).

** TODO Preprocessing

# Non c'Ã¨ molto da dire...

The data is stored in a single binary file using the format [[https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/][HDF5]]; the extraction of data from the file is achieved through the python library [[https://www.h5py.org/][h5py]].

The data is already normalized in the range $[0, 1]$, so no further action is required. 

Some sanity check were implemented (ie. all labels are numbers from 0 to 9).


* Training

The algorithm implemented is *Pegasos* with a Gaussian kernel.
